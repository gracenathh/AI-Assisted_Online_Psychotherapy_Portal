# AI-Assisted Online Psychotherapy Portal

## Introduction
This project is completed by Goh Ngee Juay, Grace Nathania, Mohit Hotchandani, and Gao Hui Min as part of our final year project. 

The aim of the project is to streamline the management and administration process behind the online psychotherapy services.
These online therapy sessions generates a tonne of relevant data that is tedious to manage. Therapists might want to store their 
recorded sessions with their patients, maintain their patients profiles, searching for particular information or recorded session, and
other expected usage that one might expect. With the web application which serves as a portal, psychotherapists might find it easier 
to handle these data and they can focus more on providing counselling. 

Also, therapists might have to replay the recorded videos to view key points of interest where patients express strong emotional
response or cues. To do this, a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is created which can be called by the web app to process and store
the time where emotions are detected in the video. Thus the name AI-Assisted in the project title.

## Setup
This project is only locally hosted as we did not manage to publicly host it.
Please refer to the UserGuide.pdf on how to use the web application and to set up the web application. 

## Report
To get a better understanding of the details of the project such as the design and methodology, the analysis of the results, and decisions
made throughout the development of the project, please refer to the Report.pdf for the information. 

## DL implementation
The DL FER is a significant part of our project besides the web application. To view how it was developed in greater detail, see
Documented_FYP.ipynb which details the development of the DL as a notebook. This is not used in the web application rather a shorter
python script is integrated into the FYP folder which is called by the web app when needed.
